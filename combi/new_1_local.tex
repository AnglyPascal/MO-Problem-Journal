	\prob{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h1268873p6622370}{ISL 2015 C1}{E}{In Lineland there are $n\geq1$ towns, arranged along a road running from left to right. Each town has a left bulldozer (put to the left of the town and facing left) and a right bulldozer (put to the right of the town and facing right). The sizes of the $2n$ bulldozers are distinct. Every time when a left and right bulldozer confront each other, the larger bulldozer pushes the smaller one off the road. On the other hand, bulldozers are quite unprotected at their rears; so, if a bulldozer reaches the rear-end of another one, the first one pushes the second one off the road, regardless of their sizes.
		
	Let $A$ and $B$ be two towns, with $B$ to the right of $A$. We say that town $A$ can sweep town $B$ away if the right bulldozer of $A$ can move over to $B$ pushing off all bulldozers it meets. Similarly town $B$ can sweep town $A$ away if the left bulldozer of $B$ can move over to $A$ pushing off all bulldozers of all towns on its way.
		
	Prove that there is exactly one town that cannot be swept away by any other one.}
